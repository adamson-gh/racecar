practice staging a file,
adding it and then 
committing it.

I created this file
git status #shows this file not being tracked
git add refresher.txt #this stages the file
git commit -m "comment"
git push #upstream contained newer items than local; did not push
git fetch
git pull # this merges the changes into my local branch
git push
